Tote -- Quadruped Robot
=======================

Tote is a small (fits inside your palm), four-legged, walking robot, with three
degrees of freedom per leg, Arduino for its brains and controlled either with a
TV remote, or by additional electronics added on top of it. It is very simple,
cheap and sturdy, for this class of robots. Its goal is to be a starting point
for anyone who wants to start building multi-legged robots.
