Bill of Materials
*****************

Required
========
   * Printed Circuit Board, the board design file is in the repository,
   * Arduino Pro Mini, 3.3V/8Mhz version,
   * 12 Sub-micro Servos, with screws and plastic horns, (I used HK-282A),
   * 12 PicoBlade Molex Sockets, for plugging in the servos,
   * 3.7V 1S LiPo Battery (I used a 300mAh battery),
   * Infra-Red Receiver (I used VS1838B).

Optional
========
   * 1000µF electrolytic capacitor, for avoiding brown-outs,
   * 2 47kΩ SMD resistors and a 47nF SMD capacitor, for battery monitoring,
   * Power Switch, for convenient on/off without unplugging the battery,
   * Piezoelectric Buzzer, for making noises,
   * Battery Charger Module, for charging the battery without unplugging,
   * Small Rubber Hose, for the feet,
   * Any additional sensors or boards you require.

At the time of writing, the required materials could be bought online for about
$50 total, but it greatly depends on availability, amount, and quality you
require. Also, shipping time.
