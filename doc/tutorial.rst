Step-by-step Tutorial
*********************

This tutorial should take you through all the steps you need to design a
walking robot like the Tote. It's for people who are not satisfied with just
blindly following a ready blueprint, but would rather want to be able to design
their own robots. This takes considerably more time, than just assembling a
robot, but it can be done one small step at a time.
