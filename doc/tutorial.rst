Step-by-step Tutorial
*********************

This tutorial should take you through all the steps you need to design a
walking robot like the Tote. It's for people who are not satisfied with just
blindly following a ready blueprint, but would rather want to be able to design
their own robots. This takes considerably more time, than just assembling a
robot, but it can be done one small step at a time.


Soldering the Pin Headers
=========================

In order to be able to connect your Pro Mini to your computer, you first need
to solder the pin header for the serial communication. Your board should have
come with with three pin headers: one 6 pins long, and two 12 pins long. You
will need the shorter, 6 pin long one. The pins in it may be straight, like in
the illustrations, or they may be angled -- it doesn't matter for our purposes.

Insert the pin header into the holes at one of the short ends of the board, as
the illustration below shows:

Now flip the board to the other side, place it on a table, and carefully solder
each of the pins to their holes. To do that, first touch the hole with the end
of your solder wire, and then briefly touch it with a hot soldering iron, as shown below:

The solder should melt and flow into the hole, filling it and securing the pin
in place. Make sure you don't connect the neighbouring pins with each other
while doing this. Each of them should have a separate electric connection only
to their own hole.
