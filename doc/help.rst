Feedback and Help

Feedback
========

If you build this robot, or, especially, if you improve on the design or extend
it, please let me know! I would love to hear about it! Perhaps your
improvements can be even incorporated in this guide (with your agreement).


Help and Support
================

This guide is provided as is, and I can't be responsible for what you actually
build using it, and whether it works as you expected or not. No guarantees. But
legalese aside, I would really like to help, so please don't hesitate to
contact me if you get stuck at some point or need advice. I am an amateur
myself, but I will try to help as much as my time and knowledge allow.


Contact
=======

There are several ways you can contact me about this guide. First, if you find
an error, a typo, an omission or generally know of a way of improving this
guide, please either send a pull request to the repository_, or report an issue
in it. This is the fastest way of having it fixed.

If you want to talk to me, I can be often found on the ``#robotics`` channel on
the Freenode_ IRC network, and also on the letsmakerobots_ forums. In both of
them I use the nick ``deshipu``, but there will also be a lot of other very
friendly people that will be able to help you.

Finally, if you are interested in my other projects, or would like to contact
me privately, visit my `home page`_.
