Modifying and Extending
***********************

Since this robot is so simple, it is very easy to modify or extend it. The
Arduino board has the Serial and IÂ²C pins free, and they can be used for
connecting any other boards, sensors or actuators that you require. The code
has to be modified to communicate with them, of course.
