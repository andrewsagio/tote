Modifying and Extending
***********************

Since this robot is so simple, it is very easy to modify or extend it. The
Arduino board has the Serial and IÂ²C pins free, and they can be used for
connecting any other boards, sensors or actuators that you require. The code
has to be modified to communicate with them, of course.


Second Version
==============

There is a second version of the design in the works. It will use the more
popular and cheaper SG90 RC servos, and thus should be even cheaper and easier
to assemble than the first one. It will, however, be bigger and weaker.

At the moment of this writing, this is work in progress, and no working
prototype has been build yet. You can find the PCB design in the repository.
