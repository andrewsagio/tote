Dice, a Small Spider Quadruped Robot
************************************

This is a small (fits in your palm) walking robot, with three degree of freedom
legs, with Ardunio (Pro Mini) for the brain and controlled by a TV remote. It
is supposed to be very simple, very cheap and very sturdy (but please don't
step on it).
